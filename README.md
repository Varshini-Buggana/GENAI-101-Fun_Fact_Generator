# Fun Facts Generator App

## Overview
The **Fun Facts Generator App** is a fun, interactive web application that displays random "fun facts" about the User topic. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app allows users to apply the concepts of prompt engineering, context setting, and handling AI limitations (hallucinations) learned in GenAI 101.

## Purpose
This app was designed as a capstone project for the GenAI 101 workshop, allowing participants to:

- Understand prompt engineering and context setting.
- Recognize and address potential hallucinations in AI-generated content.
- Practice creating and customizing a simple, shareable web application using Pieces Copilot and basic web technologies.

## Key Features
- **Random Fun Fact Generation**: Displays a random, user-defined fun fact each time you click the button.
- **Facts Generated using GenAI**: Users can personalize the app by adding their own unique facts.
- **Easy Hosting on GitHub Pages**: With no additional setup, users can deploy their app online to share with others.
